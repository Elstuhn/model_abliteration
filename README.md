# Decensoring of Models using Model Abliteration
Used orthogonal decomposition to abliterate models to achieve a 90% decrease in censoring 

**92.5% (111/120) => 2.5% (3/120) censor rate**

# Repository Details
main.ipynb contains a quick and brief tutorial on model abliteration using the llama 3.2b 1b instruct model whereas main.py provides the main framework for decensoring huggingface models

# Dataset
Dataset used currently consists of 4 different categories. Fraud, hate_harass_violence, illegal and malware.

# Next Plans
Optimize gpu memory usage
